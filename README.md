## Current state of implementation

* Some code to try supporting git history data, builds database by looping through commits. No evaluation metric in place at the moment.
* Another evaluation method tested: Removing random lines from source files and checking the exit codes of running specific tests and all tests, currently just stores the exit codes in database.
* Test functions are now also mapped to lines of code. Testfile is parsed and function lines are extracted. If a testfile has changes, only the affected changes are considered.
* I've had success with "flask" (around 4000 commits) and "rich" (around 700 commits) from github.
 
## Usage

### Initialization

1. checkout the project
2. in project directory run `make install` - that will:
  * create virtual environment
  * download all the dependencies
  * install `tests_selector` as a tool
3. switch to directory with target project
4. install all the dependencies needed for testing (should be installed into the same tests_selector virtual environment)
5. go back to `tests_selector` directory
6. execute `tests_selector_init path/to/target_project`

### Running tests related to the changes

1. switch to directory with target project
2. execute `tests_selector`

# Development

* ~~Don't forget to run `make install` before you are going to try the latest changes~~ - not needed as all the changes in source files are available immediately, just call the needed command line tool from the package
