# First implementation

## these two files made to work with "flask" -project

## Hardcoded things in "specific test runner"

* Changed src files and test files ("git_changed_test_files()" and "git_changed_src_files()")

* Test name parsing in "main()" and "run_tests_and_cov()" because coverage data had varying test names ("context").
